\chapter{} \vnum What was from the beginning,\footnote{Or ‘from the authority’ (as in sovereignty, rulership)} what we heard, what we saw with our eyes, what we watched and our hands handled, concerning the Message\footnote{Or ‘System’, or ‘Logic’, or ‘Argument’} of life---\vnum and the life was revealed,\footnote{Or `made real', or `made conspicuous/remarkable'; and hereafter} and we have seen and give testimony, and we report also to you\footnote{Plural, and hereafter} the eternal life which was beside\footnote{Literally ‘up against’} the Father and was revealed to us---\vnum that which we have seen and heard, we report to you, so that you can have partnership with us. But indeed our partnership \infer{is} together with the Father, and together with His Son, Jesus the Anointed One. \vnum And we write these things to you so that our joy can be filled up.
