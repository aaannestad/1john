\book{1 John}
	
\chapter{} \vnum What was from the beginning,\footnote{Or ‘from the authority’ (as in sovereignty, rulership)} what we heard, what we saw with our eyes, what we watched and our hands handled, concerning the Message\footnote{Or ‘System’, or ‘Logic’, or ‘Argument’} of life---\vnum and the life was revealed,\footnote{Or `made real', or `made conspicuous/remarkable'; and hereafter} and we have seen and give testimony, and we report also to you\footnote{Plural, and hereafter} the eternal life which was beside\footnote{Literally ‘up against’} the Father and was revealed to us---\vnum that which we have seen and heard, we report to you, so that you can have partnership with us. But indeed our partnership \infer{is} together with the Father, and together with His Son, Jesus the Anointed One. \vnum And we write these things to you so that our joy can be filled up.

\vnum And \focus{this} is the report that we have heard from Him, and \infer{that} we report\footnote{Or `proclaim', or `bring news of'} to you: that God is light, and \infer{as for} darkness inside Him, there is none at all.\footnote{Lit. `there is not none'; a negative concord construction} \vnum If we were to say that that we have partnership with Him and \infer{yet} walk about in the darkness, we are lying and are not practising\footnote{Or `doing', or `engaging in', or perhaps `bringing about'} the truth. \vnum If, though, we are walking about in the light, as He is in the light, we have partnership with each other, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleans\footnote{Or `prunes', or `sifts'; and hereafter} us from all sin. \vnum If we should say that we do not have sin, we lead ourselves astray, and the truth is not in us. \vnum If we acknowledge our sins, God is faithful and righteous\footnote{Or `just', or `dutiful'} so that He can release us from \infer{our} sins and clean us from all unrighteousness.\footnote{Or `unjustness', or `wrongdoing'} \vnum If we were to say that we have not sinned, we make\footnote{\textit{Poioumen}; the same verb as `practice' above} Him a liar, and His word is not in us.
